# Franka_Emika_Panda_Robot_Arm

## Detection of Human Movements: Using the MediaPipe library, 
joint points were successfully detected and the angle values ​​between these points were calculated in real time.
was calculated. The coordinates of the joint points are obtained accurately during the image processing process. 
Angles were determined using the vector-based angle calculation method. 

## Simulation Environment and Interaction: Robot with objects such as tables and boxes defined in the PyBullet environment 
The arm has successfully interacted. This shows that the robot arm can work in harmony with the environment. 
shows.Real-time simulation has been able to quickly imitate human movements. 


## Imitation Ability of Robot Arm: Franka Panda robot arm in PyBullet simulation environment, 
It was moved successfully according to the angle values ​​taken from MediaPipe. robot arm 
joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist) human movements
